          My journey in cybersecurity began during my elementary years when I
          first learned about ethical hacking and the importance of securing
          systems from malicious attacks. Since then, I have dedicated myself to
          staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and threats in the
          cybersecurity landscape.

          resources that can help individuals and organizations safeguard their

        <h2>What is Network Security?</h2>
        <p>
          Network security is a set of policies, practices, and technologies
          designed to protect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability
          of computer networks and data. It involves both hardware and software
          technologies to guard against unauthorized access, misuse, or theft.

        <h2>Key Components of Network Security</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Firewalls:</strong> Firewalls act as a barrier between
            trusted and untrusted networks, controlling incoming and outgoing
            traffic based on predetermined security rules.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):</strong> IDS monitor
            network traffic for suspicious activity and potential threats,
            alerting administrators to possible breaches.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Virtual Private Networks (VPN):</strong> VPNs provide secure
            remote access to the network, encrypting data transmissions to
            protect against interception.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Access Control:</strong> Implementing access control
            measures ensures that only authorized users can access sensitive
            resources and information.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Threats to Network Security</h2>
        <p>
          Understanding common threats is crucial for effective network
          security. Some of the most prevalent threats include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Malware:</strong> Malicious software that can disrupt,
            damage, or gain unauthorized access to systems.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Phishing:</strong> A social engineering attack where
            attackers deceive individuals into providing sensitive information.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:</strong> Attacks that
            overwhelm a network or service, rendering it unavailable to users.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:</strong> These attacks
            occur when a third party intercepts communication between two
            parties to steal or manipulate data.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Best Practices for Network Security</h2>
        <p>
          To enhance network security, consider implementing the following best
          practices:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Regularly update and patch systems to protect against
            vulnerabilities.
          </li>
          <li>Use strong, unique passwords and change them frequently.</li>
          <li>
            Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments.
          </li>
          <li>
            Educate employees about security awareness and best practices.
          </li>
          <li>
            Implement network segmentation to limit access and control the flow
            of traffic.
          </li>
        </ul>
